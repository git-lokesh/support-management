# Support Management System

This project analyzes customer support ticket data to extract insights and visualize distributions. It includes ticket types, subjects, customer details, and resolution times. The analysis focuses on handling data cleaning, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and creating visualizations like bar and pie charts to show ticket distributions and common issues over time. The project uses Python with libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform these tasks.
